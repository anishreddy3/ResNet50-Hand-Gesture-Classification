# Residual Network for Image Classification in Keras

## Work from Deep learning Specialization : Course 4 : Week 2 : Assignment 1

## Implemented the basic building blocks of ResNets and combined these building blocks to implement and train a state of the art neural network for hand gesture classification.

Residual Networks were introduced by [He et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) which allows us to train very deep neural netowrks.
