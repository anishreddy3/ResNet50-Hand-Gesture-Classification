# Residual Network for Image Classification in Keras

## Work from Deep learning Specialization : Course 4 : Week 2 : Assignment 1

## Implemented the basic building blocks of ResNets and combined these building blocks to implement and train a state of the art neural network for hand gesture classification.

Residual Networks were introduced by [He et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) which allows us to train very deep neural netowrks.

### Results:

Input image shape: (1, 64, 64, 3)
class prediction vector [p(0), p(1), p(2), p(3), p(4), p(5)] = 
[[ 1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
